In an era characterized by unprecedented concerns involving climate change, it is imperative to establish a platform where individuals can connect the weather events they experience in their everyday lives to the greater trends resulting from global warming. Such a platform would empower people to establish a link between their day-to-day weather experiences and the consequences of carbon emissions and global warming. We hope this connection will serve as a starting point, inspiring individuals to make changes in their own lives or advocate for meaningful climate legislation. 
It is worth noting that many individuals with no climate science background often equate climate change to weather (Lang, 2014). For example, if you were to ask a random person to describe climate change, there is a high probability that they mention something about the weather, or weather patterns such as temperature. We are able to leverage this information and data to engage and educate a large audience. Knowing that people relate climate change to weather, we can use the history of weather patterns over time to educate people on how weather is affected by carbon emissions. The ongoing trends in carbon emissions have influenced daily weather patterns that we are able to track over time. For example, according to the 2022 climate report released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), “North America’s temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.49 degrees fahrenheit since 1981.” 
To understand how weather patterns have changed over time, we are using data from NOAA’s weather station database. The database is an excellent source for our project as it contains extensive daily weather tracking information from 1,219 weather stations across the United States. Although the database tracks many weather patterns, we will specifically be focusing on minimum and maximum temperatures, precipitation, and snowfall from 1940 - 2022. We are focusing on these statistics as these variables are some of the key average weather patterns and climate occurrences people experience in their day-to-day lives, and thus what can most easily relate to the public.
Although it is easy to have a table with numbers reflecting weather patterns such as temperature increasing over time, it is more beneficial to use visuals to display information. A 2008 study showed that within a group of researchers working with climate data, about 58% of the visualizations were at least in part for the purpose of making the scientific results comprehensible to important decision makers, stakeholders, and the media (Nocke et al., 2008). Visuals can help transmit information in an easy-to-understand and fast manner, two critical components when trying to impart knowledge to the general populace. From the Google trends study, we know that individuals seek out information on climate change after experiencing an extreme weather event (Lang, 2014). Our visualizations aim to illustrate the influence of global warming on weather patterns in a manner that is easy to comprehend, highlighting subtle changes that may go unnoticed amongst the increase of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and wildfires. 
Another important aspect in creating visual representations that are easy for the public to understand is the interactivity of the piece. While there are certain benefits to having a static display or image, such as simplicity and immediacy in seeing all the information, in a small study done to see the effectiveness of different visualizations as tools to connect the general public to climate change research, "clarity was con-sidered to be a strength of the interactive visualization and commonly noted as a weakness of the static piece" (Newell et al., 2016). This sentiment is centered around the visuals used for this particular study, however certain specific opinions shared, such as that which the interactive visual gave a better sense of movement and change over a period of time, are more widely applicable. One of the main objectives for this project is to give people a sense of the scale of the effects of climate change, and to be able to see these changes unfold over time without any difficulty navigating the data. 
Our project addresses some of the gaps that exist in current climate research. Primarily, we tackle the bridge between visualization and climate data. As noted above, visualization provides accessibility to data that json or csv files do not. Instead of ignoring the evidence for climate change, users will be able to see the effects for themselves. This is succinctly summed up in the work of Nocke et al, who state, “a major task for future developments is to further bridge the gap between climate and visualization expertise” (Nocke et al., 2008). Once people are educated on climate change, they are more likely to assist in the effort to reverse it. In particular, Radhika Iyengar identified climate education as a “key climate risk mitigation strategy,” (Cho, 2023). While secondary to the visualization project, the website will provide resources for individual and collective activism. This could include local and global groups that fight climate change, links to relevant politicians to contact, or organizations to donate to. Including possibilities for action is thus important, giving newly informed people direct ways to help.
In visualizing climate data, we are providing an accessible resource for climate education. We hope that more people will be more likely to act as a result of this project – knowledge alone is not enough to reverse the effects of climate change, and we need as many people as possible fighting against it.
