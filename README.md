# Undercover Salamander
## United States Climate Trends Mapped Throughout Time

### Abstract
Visualizing how weather patterns have changed over time can be an essential tool for understanding climate change and encouraging modifications to daily life. Our project leverages  data from NOAAâ€™s weather station database to analyze changes in minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, and snowfall in the United States since 1940. Through visualizations, we illustrate the evolving weather patterns, highlighting the urgency of the impacts of climate change. For instance, comparing 1942 to 2020, Charleston, South Carolina experienced a notable increase in average daily rainfall from 27.245mm to 47.429mm. Similar trends can be seen in temperature and snowfall which reinforce our understanding of the correlation between weather and climate change. Our project aims to bridge the gap between data-driven insights and public awareness, fostering an environment where people are working together to address issues posed by climate change.

This is your main project README which will contain instructions on how to build and run your project. You can delete and overwrite the contents of this README file at any point. We'll talk about what should be included in this file later in the semester.

This initial project template contains a few workflows (defined in `.github/workflows`) to help with your project development:

1. `checks.yml`: A workflow that runs anytime a PR is opened, or a new commit is pushed to a branch with an open PR. At some point in the semester, please modify/add steps for the checks you wish to run (e.g. adding checks for tests & style). Your repository is configured to require all status checks to pass before merging a PR.

2. `merge.yml`: A workflow that runs when a commit is pushed to the `main` branch, like when a Pull Request is merged. If you need to deploy your project, you should add some steps in this file. When this workflow succeeds, a message will be sent to your project channel in Slack.

3. `issue.yml`: A workflow that will notify your project channel in Slack that a new Issue was created.

In general, your development workflow will be to open one (or more) Issues in any given week, write the code in the coming week, and then open and merge one (or more) PRs that address the corresponding Issue(s) from the previous week. When opening an Issue & Pull Request, please complete the relevant fields in the description (the templates are defined in the `.github` directory).

Your first task is to create/review/merge a Pull Request that addresses Issue #1, which consists of creating a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file for your project.

To compile and test:
On install: npm install (to install dependencies)
To run on a local server: npm run dev
Go on localhost:3000 to see a running version of the server!
